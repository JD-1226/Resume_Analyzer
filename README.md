## Purpose of the Project

In todayâ€™s competitive job market, job seekers struggle to:

## Why This Project Was Created

This project was developed to **bridge the gap** between resume data and job market intelligence.

Itâ€™s especially useful for:
- **Freshers and students** looking for internships.
- **Professionals** exploring better job matches.
- **Career counselors** or **placement departments** managing multiple resumes.
